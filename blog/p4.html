                    <p>It’s no secret that free speech is under attack in America. For example, the speech of conservative speaker Ann Coulter was canceled by the Berkeley University of California since they couldn’t find a venue that provided sufficient protection for her. A similar so called “heckler’s veto” also shut down the speech of Milo Yiannopoulos a few months earlier. These two occurrences are part of a larger trend in America where conservative speakers cannot speak at liberal universities. While this trend is often portrayed as a free speech problem, the root of this problem is the way we do politics in this country. Politics has become a zero-sum game where one side wins at the expense of the other, a paradigm that we’re witnessing across colleges around the country.</p>

                    <h2 id="Winners and losers">When someone is winning, someone else must be losing</h2>
                    <p> The Trump administration had no significant legislative achievements at its 100 day mark. Recently however, the House of Representatives passed an Obamacare repeal bill. Virtually all news coverage describes this a “win” for the Trump administration. For example, a CNN article covering this event is titled: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/04/politics/health-care-analysis/index.html">“Health care win could be shot in arm Trump, GOP need”</a>. The media also play a role in cementing this win/lose paradigm. And now that we know who the winners are, the next question is who are the losers? The democrats who support Obamacare and those who have benefited from it. The biggest losers are low income families with high medical expenses. They simply cannot afford their medication without Obamacare. This problem is so severe that someone created a website for these people to <a href="http://mailmetothegop.com/">mail their ashes</a> to politicians who voted for the Obamacare repeal if they die due to losing their health care.</p>
                    <p>On the other end of the political spectrum, democrats have been enraged by republicans’ bill to repeal Obamacare. An article by Paul Waldman on The Week is titled <a href="https://theweek.com/articles/696704/how-democrats-take-revenge-republicans-healthcare-abomination">“How Democrats will take revenge on Republicans for their health-care abomination”</a>. The tone of the title says it all. Right now republicans are winning and democrats are losing. Nevertheless, the democratic will channel their anger into winning the 2018 midterm elections and the 2020 presidential elections. They will have their politicians pass what legislation they want, and it will be the Republicans who are losing. A few years later the cycle will repeat itself.</p>
                    <p>To be clear, I have no problem with Republicans and democrats disagreeing with each other, I just don’t like how ideological differences has led to both sides feeling they need to win at the expense of the other. Such behavior is unsustainable and is threatening our democracy.</p>
                    <p>Student protests at Berkeley University of California is illustrate why our democracy cannot go on like this. They have gotten so bad protesters of opposing political views sometimes physically assault each other. As stated before, most people say this is a free speech problem and I agree to an extent. However, the larger problem is the cut-throat tone of politics in this nation. In this case, discussion of both sides deteriorated into mocking and berating those of the other side. Everyone is trying to score a win for their side by diminishing the views of those who oppose them. They don’t even listen to each other anymore. What kind of democracy is this?</p>

                    <h2 id="shifting-the-paradigm">Shifting the paradigm</h2>
                    <p><img src="" alt="" /> We need a paradigm shift. We cannot afford to continue conducting politics with a win/lose mentality. Instead we need to shift to a win/win mentality—we need to move beyond scoring points for our political tribe and actually engage those on the other side because they’re our allies that we must work with to build a more perfect union, not opponents to be humiliated and defeated. Making this shift won’t be easy, and now is the time to roll up our sleeves.</p>
                    <p>We can begin this shift by seeking to understand those on the other side of the political aisle before we promote our own views. Free speech isn’t just about tolerating the diversity of ideas. It’s also about learning from the diversity of ideas—understanding another’s perspective. So what do you have to learn you ask?</p>
                    <p>For starters, liberals need to learn that several low income white folks have struggled in Obama’s economy. For example there are several cities that once flourished through coal mining, but now having trouble making ends meet. We need to help them find employment. We also need to understand that they voted for Trump because they believed he would bring their jobs back. They were just doing what they believed was best for the country.</p>
                    <p>Conservatives need to learn that denying the supreme court nomination of Merrick Garland for more than a year is going to enrage the liberal base. While they celebrate Trump nominating Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme court, they cannot deny that an injustice was done. Conservatives like Mitch McConnell add insult to injury when they tell angry liberals that they need to “grow up”.</p>
                    <p>We must adopt a new approach to politics where we empathize with those of differing political views. Do not wait for this shift to happen. I want you to have a meaningful discussion with someone you disagree with politically. Hear them out and make a genuine effort to understand them. Connect with them. Don’t judge them. Share with them what you believe. And let them know how valuable their beliefs are.</p>
