                    <p>You can do better. Your campus has been divided by ideological lines since the election of president Trump, a polarization that culminated a few months ago when the speech of conservative speaker Milo Yiannopoulos was canceled due to violent protests. Yet your predecessors fought for free speech on your campus fifty years ago, values that you now reject. Now with the coming of Ann Coulter’s speech on your campus, you have a chance to decide how you really feel about free speech. Will you allow her to express ideas you do not agree with or will you cancel her speech the same way you canceled Yiannopoulos’s speech? The choice is yours.</p>

                    <p>You spearheaded the Free Speech Movement (FSM) of the 1960’s. You staged large sit ins, advocating for more liberating rules regarding political activism on campus. You endured clashes with police as your administrators tried to silence your voices. But you would not be silenced. You kept demonstrating. Eventually, your administrators caved and relaxed the rules regarding political activism. You won. Afterwards, you created massive protests against the Vietnam War and other major issues of your time. You began a wave massive free speech that impacted the whole country. You can begin another wave today.</p>
                    <p>You were shouting for free speech from the roof tops when the speech you agreed with was censored. Now you choose to drown the voices of the conservatives you agree with. You have become the censor that you opposed fifty years ago. While you are entitled to believe the ideas of Coulter and Yiannopoulos are dangerous and repulsive, do not silence their voices. Letting Ann Coulter speak freely at your university Does not mean that you agree with her message. All it means is that you respect her right to express whatever controversial ideas she has. You can still believe in what you prefer.</p>

                    <p>With that said, where has your passion for free speech gone fifty years later? We all love to advocate for free speech when the speech we want to express is censored. <strong>But only those who advocate for free speech even when others express ideas they disagree with truly value it.</strong> You have loved free speech when it was easy, and now you must learn to love it when it is hard. The national spotlight is on you. This is the perfect opportunity to show us that you do value free speech. It is time to rekindle that passion that consumed you fifty years ago.</p>
                    <p>Silencing the voices of conservatives will backfire in the long run. When you create violent demonstrations which cancel speeches conservatives such as Yiannopoulos, you help them to create a narrative of being a free speech martyr. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2017/02/01/berkeley-cancels-speech-by-breitbrart-writer-milo-amid-intense-protests/?utm_term=.98435e5a9101">You play right into their hands</a>. You attract national attention which energizes the conservative base. In the long run they will claim the moral high ground of being free speech advocates. Do not give them that kind of power. Do not fall into the trap. Letting speakers like Ann Coulter speak at your university gives them far less notoriety than trying to silence their voices. Let them speak. Reduce their influence.</p>

                    <p>When Ann Coulter speaks at your Campus on immigration, let her spew whatever vitriol she has prepared for you. Let her go through every single one of her conservative talking points. And when she is done, remember that <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/25/politics/michelle-obama-dnc-speech/index.html">our motto is, when they go low, we go high</a> and counter her negative message with a positive one of your own. When Ann Coulter claims that <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/video/2017/02/13/coulter-on-immigration-policy-our-country-is-not-a-battered-womans-shelter/">the “public has been begging for less immigration overall”</a>, tell her that many of us are immigrants and we welcome immigrants into this country with open arms. Tell her that immigrants have been a driving force for the excellence of America, an impetus that propelled America in being the greatest nation on earth. Tell her that immigrants contribute much more to this country than they will ever take away. Show her that you have chosen to take the high road, for it is the path to victory.</p>
