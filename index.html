                        I'm an undergraduate student at <a href="https://vt.edu">Virginia Tech</a>.
                        I created this blog for promoting free speech as part of a course assignment.
                        Free speech has become a hot topic in America recently and my goal is to share my insights.
                        I hope you enjoy my content!

                    <p>You can do better. Your campus has been divided by ideological lines since the election of president Trump, a polarization that culminated a few months ago when the speech of conservative speaker Milo Yiannopoulos was canceled due to violent protests. Yet your predecessors fought for free speech on your campus fifty years ago, values that you now reject. Now with the coming of Ann Coulter’s speech on your campus, you have a chance to decide how you really feel about free speech. Will you allow her to express ideas you do not agree with or will you cancel her speech the same way you canceled Yiannopoulos’s speech? The choice is yours.

                    <h2><a href="blog/p4.html">America's Polarization Problem</a></h2>
                    <p>
                        It’s no secret that free speech is under attack in America. For example, the speech of conservative speaker Ann Coulter was canceled by the Berkeley University of California since they couldn’t find a venue that provided sufficient protection for her. A similar so called “heckler’s veto” also shut down the speech of Milo Yiannopoulos a few months earlier. These two occurrences are part of a larger trend in America where conservative speakers cannot speak at liberal universities. While this trend is often portrayed as a free speech problem, the root of this problem is the way we do politics in this country. Politics has become a zero-sum game where one side wins at the expense of the other, a paradigm that we’re witnessing across colleges around the country.

                    <h2>Beware the False Dictator</h2>
                    <p>President Trump wants to be a dictator. He retaliates against whoever criticizes and would silence them if possible. This has lead him to antagonize the press by calling them the “enemy of the people”. President Trump chose the wrong country to live out his fantasy. Congress, the judiciary, the press and comedians of all people stand in his way. Despite these barriers, the Trump Presidency mimics a dictatorship in some respects. His ability to circumvent measures designed to limit his power is why I characterize him as a false dictator.

                    <p>
                        The modern world threatens free speech. Government surveillance programs around the world such as PRISM in the United States may stifle free speech. Furthermore, private companies often monitor what their employees say about them online and may take disciplinary action. In this article, I discuss ways to get past these obstacles to speaking freely, methods which are freely available.
